A GRID is a group or network of elementary NODES. Each NODE can be associated to one or multiple GRIDS. There is two kind of GRIDS:
<ul>
<li>A VIEW is a list of NODES we simply want to group to be seen or accessed together,</li>
<li>PROC is a list of NODES associated to a common data processing that produces outputs (graphs
and/or elaborated data), and/or optional editable data FORMS.</li>
</ul>
