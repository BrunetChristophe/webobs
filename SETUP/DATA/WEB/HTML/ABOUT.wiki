TITRE|About WebObs...
~~Introduction:
<p>Seismological and Volcanological observatories have common needs and often common practical problems for multi disciplinary data monitoring applications.
<p>Access to integrated data in real-time and estimation of measurements uncertainties are keys for an efficient interpretation, but instruments variety, heterogeneity of data sampling and acquisition systems lead to difficulties that may hinder crisis management. 
<p>In Guadeloupe observatory, we have developed in the last years an operational system, WebObs, that attempts to answer the questions in the context of a pluri-instrumental observatory. 
<p>Based on a single computer server, open source scripts (Matlab, Perl, Bash) and a Web interface, the system proposes:
- an extended database for networks management, stations and sensors (maps, station file with log history, technical characteristics, meta-data, photos and associated documents);
- html-form interfaces for manual data input/editing and export (like geochemical analysis, some of the deformation measurements, ...);
- routine data processing with dedicated automatic scripts for each technique, production of validated data outputs, static graphs on preset moving time intervals, and possible e-mail alarms;
- computers, acquisition processes, stations and individual sensors status automatic check with simple criteria (files update and signal quality), displayed as synthetic pages for technical control.			
<p>In the special case of seismology, WebObs includes a digital stripchart multichannel continuous seismogram associated with EarthWorm acquisition chain, 
event classification database, location scripts, automatic shakemaps and regional catalog with associated hypocenter maps accessed through a user request form.			
<p>This system leads to a real-time Internet access for integrated monitoring and becomes a strong support for scientists and technicians exchange, 
 and is widely open to interdisciplinary real-time modeling. It has been set up at Martinique observatory, Montserrat Volcanological Observatory, and the geomagnetic observatory of Addis Abeba in Ethiopia.

~~Basic concepts:
=== 2.1 NODES ===
A **NODE** is the central WO element associated with following attributes:
- a long name, a short name (ALIAS) and optional code (FID),
- a date of start, a date of end (both optional),
- an optional type (short string),
- an optional location (latitude, longitude, elevation),
- a location map (graph), Google Maps and Google Earth links,
- optional text contents for "informations", "installation" and "access",
- an optional sensor description associated with a calibration table (see below),
- a list of user-defined features (also free text contents)
- attached documents, photos and diagrams,
- a project,
- events log associated with date and operator list,
- a list of associated **VIEWS** and/or **PROCS**,
- a validity flag.
Examples of what a **NODE** can be:
- an instrumental station or a part of it,
- a site for data sampling or measurement,
- a site of any interest,
- a mobile equipment, an instrument, a building, a vehicule, ...
- a journal board, an event description (e.g. an historical earthquake), ...
In the specific case of instrumental station, a calibration table is attached to the **NODE** sensors that describes each channel characteristics and history:
- date and time of validity
- channel number, name, unit, code, S/N, offset, factor, gain, min/max values, azimuth, latitude, longitude, elevation, depth,
=== 2.2 GRIDS: VIEWS and PROCS ===
A **GRID** is a group of **NODES**. Each **NODE** can be associated to one or multiple **GRIDS**. **GRIDS** are presented through a specific page with:
- purpose (text content),
- specifications: operator owner, number of **NODES**, type,
- list of **NODES**: a complete table with alias, names, location, start/end dates, type, ...
- location map (if **NODES** have location coordinates),
- informations (text content),
- references (text content),
- a graphical representation of **NODES** links with associated **GRIDS**.
There is two kind of **GRIDS**:
- A **VIEW** is a list of **NODES** we simply want to group to be seen or accessed together,
- A **PROC** is a list of **NODES** associated to a common data processing that produces outputs (graphs and/or elaborated data), and/or optional editable data **FORMS**.
=== 2.3 FORMS ===
A **FORM** is a web interface for manual data input/display/edit. A form is an optional tool of a **PROC** that defines associated **NODES**.

~~Technical documentation:
=== Wiki pages edition ===
Most of text contents in WO accepts a "Wiki" syntax for basic text formatting: nodes events, features and description, grids (views/procs) description page, and any wiki page created by user.

A text that can be in **bold**, //italic// or __underlined__.

A bullet list:
- item,
- item \
  with continuation line,
- item.

A numerical list:
# item 1,
# item 2.

A horizontal rule: 
----
Different levels of titles:
<H2>Title 2</H2>
===Title 3 ===
